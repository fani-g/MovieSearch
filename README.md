# MovieSearch

This mini project uses plain Javascript (JQuery for DOM Manipulation), HTML5 and CSS.
One page with a search bar where the user searches the title of the movie and 

• The movie poster 
• A short description of the movie 
• Metadata and other information about the movie (cast, director, duration, etc.)

There is no search button, when the user stops writing then the results are popping to the screen.
